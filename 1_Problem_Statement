Problem or challenge:

* Inefficient and unreliable monitoring of water tank sludge levels.
* Potential health risks due to contaminated water from sludge buildup.
* Time-consuming and labor-intensive manual cleaning processes.

Context and significance:

* Water is a vital resource, and ensuring its quality is crucial for public health and well-being.
* Sludge accumulation in water tanks is a common issue that affects households, communities, and industries.
* Effective water tank management is essential for preventing water-borne diseases and optimizing water usage.

Existing solutions or approaches and limitations:

* Manual inspection: This method is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to human error.
* Water quality testing: While essential for determining water purity, it does not directly measure sludge levels.
* Professional tank cleaning services: These can be expensive and require scheduling, leading to potential delays.

These existing approaches often fail to provide real-time monitoring, early warning systems, or automated solutions to the problem of sludge buildup.
