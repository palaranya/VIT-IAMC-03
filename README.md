### Project Title: Sludge Level Monitoring System

### Overview
This project aims to develop a microcontroller-based system to monitor the sludge level in a water tank. An ultrasonic sensor is used to measure the water level, and when the sludge level exceeds a predefined threshold, the system activates an LED and buzzer to alert the user.

### Hardware Components
* Arduino Uno
* Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
* Active Buzzer
* LED
* Resistor
* Jumper Wires
* Breadboard
* Power Supply

### Software
* Arduino IDE

### Project Structure
* **code:** Contains the Arduino code for the project.
* **circuit_diagram:** Contains the circuit diagram for the project.
* **README.md:** This file.

### How to Use
1. **Hardware Setup:**
   * Assemble the circuit according to the provided circuit diagram.
   * Connect the Arduino to your computer.
2. **Software Setup:**
   * Open the Arduino IDE.
   * Upload the provided code to the Arduino board.
3. **Calibration:**
   * Calibrate the ultrasonic sensor to ensure accurate distance measurements. Adjust the `sludgeThreshold` variable in the code accordingly.
4. **Operation:**
   * Place the sensor in the water tank.
   * The system will continuously monitor the water level.
   * When the sludge level exceeds the threshold, the LED will turn on, and the buzzer will sound.

### Code Explanation
* **trigPin:** Trigger pin of the ultrasonic sensor.
* **echoPin:** Echo pin of the ultrasonic sensor.
* **ledPin:** Pin connected to the LED.
* **buzzerPin:** Pin connected to the buzzer.
* **max_height:** Maximum height of the water tank.
* **threshold:** Sludge level threshold.
* **duration:** Pulse duration of the ultrasonic sensor.
* **distance:** Calculated distance from the sensor to the water surface.
* **sludgeLevel:** Calculated sludge level.

### Additional Notes
* Adjust the `max_height` and `threshold` variables according to your specific tank and requirements.
* For better accuracy, consider using a more precise ultrasonic sensor and implementing calibration routines.
* Explore additional features like data logging or wireless communication for remote monitoring.
