Focus: Develop a microcontroller-based prototype to detect elevated sludge levels in a water tank and alert the user.
System Inputs: Ultrasonic sensor readings to measure water level.
System Outputs: Visual and audible alert (LED, buzzer).
Limitations: Prototype will be designed for a single tank and assumes a static tank environment.
Solution Aims
Accurately measure water level and calculate sludge level based on tank height.
Reliably detect when sludge level exceeds a predefined threshold.
Provide clear and timely alerts to the user.
Demonstrate proof of concept for a more comprehensive water tank management system.
Constraints and Limitations
Hardware Limitations: The chosen microcontroller and sensors may have limitations in terms of accuracy, processing power, and memory.
Environmental Factors: The system's performance may be affected by water temperature, turbidity, and sensor fouling.
Prototype Scope: This project focuses on the core functionality of sludge level detection and alerting. Additional features (e.g., data logging, remote monitoring) are out of scope.
Power Consumption: The system should be designed to minimize power consumption for potential battery operation.
